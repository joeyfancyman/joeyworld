<p>helo here this song </p>
<p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight <br>
Not a footprint to be seen <br>
A kingdom of isolation <br>
And it looks like I'm the queen <br>
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside <br>
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried <br>
Don't let them in, don't let them see <br>
Be the good girl you always have to be <br>
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know <br>
Well, now they know <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
Can't hold it back anymore <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
Turn away and slam the door <br>
I don't care what they're going to say <br>
Let the storm rage on <br>
The cold never bothered me anyway <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
Can't hold it back anymore <br>
Let it go, let it go <br>
Turn away and slam the door <br>
Let it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go) <br>
Let it go <br>
Let it go <br>
Let it go <br>
It's funny how some distance makesâ€¦ </p>
